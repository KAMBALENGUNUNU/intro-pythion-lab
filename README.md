# üöÄ Question I: Age Calculator Using a Function 
This program will ask for your name and year of birth, then use a function to calculate your age as of 2025.

Method:


Get User Input: The program will first prompt the user to enter their name and then their year of birth. 

Define a Function: A function named calculate_age is defined. This function takes the birth_year as an argument.


Calculate Age: Inside the function, the age is calculated by subtracting the birth_year from the current year, which is specified as 2025. 

Display the Result: The function's result is then printed in the specified format, showing the user's name and their calculated age.

```PYTHON
def calculate_age(birth_year):
  """
  Calculates the age based on the birth year, assuming the current year is 2025.
  """
  current_year = 2025
  age = current_year - birth_year
  return age

# 1. Ask the user to input their name.
user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# 2. Ask the user to input their year of birth.
year_of_birth = int(input("Please enter your year of birth (e.g., 2000): "))

# 3. Use the function to calculate the age.
user_age = calculate_age(year_of_birth)

# 4. Display the result.
print(f"Thank you {user_name}, your age is: {user_age}")
```

# üöÄ Question II: Check Palindrome
This function checks if a word or phrase entered by the user is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Method:

Get User Input: The program asks the user for a string.

Clean the String: To accurately check for a palindrome, it's best to remove spaces and convert the string to a single case (e.g., lowercase). 

Reverse the String: The cleaned string is then reversed. A simple way to do this in Python is using slicing [::-1].

Compare Strings: The original cleaned string is compared to the reversed string. If they are identical, it's a palindrome.


Print the Result: The program prints "Yes, it is a palindrome" if it is, and "No, it is not a palindrome" otherwise. 

```PYTHON
def check_palindrome():
  """
  Asks for a string input and checks if it is a palindrome.
  """
  # Ask the user to input a string.
  input_string = input("Enter a string to check if it's a palindrome: ")

  # Clean the string: remove spaces and convert to lowercase.
  cleaned_string = input_string.replace(" ", "").lower()

  # Reverse the cleaned string.
  reversed_string = cleaned_string[::-1]

  # Check if the cleaned string is the same as the reversed one.
  if cleaned_string == reversed_string:
    print("Yes, it is a palindrome")
  else:
    print("No, it is not a palindrome")

# Call the function to run the check.
check_palindrome()
```

# üöÄ Question III: Iterating Over Two Text Inputs
This function takes two separate texts from the user, combines them, and then creates a list of every character in the combined text.

Method:


Get Two Inputs: The function will prompt the user to enter two separate texts. 


Combine Texts: The two input strings are concatenated (joined together) into a single string. 

Iterate and Collect Characters: The program then iterates through the combined string. Each character is added to a new list. A list comprehension [char for char in combined_text] is a concise way to achieve this.


Print the Result: Finally, the program prints the resulting list of characters. 

```PYTHON
def combine_and_iterate():
  """
  Asks for two texts, combines them, and returns a list of their characters.
  """
  # 1. Ask the user to enter two separate texts.
  text1 = input("Enter the first text: ")
  text2 = input("Enter the second text: ")

  # 2. Combine the two texts into one.
  combined_text = text1 + text2

  # 3. Iterate over each character and return a collection (list).
  character_list = [char for char in combined_text]

  # 4. Print the message with the resulting list.
  print(f"The combined characters are: {character_list}")

# Call the function to run it.
combine_and_iterate()
```
